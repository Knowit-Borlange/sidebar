# `simpler-sidebar-css3`

This plugin is a version of `simpler-sidebar` that uses css3 animations instead of jquery animations. This should be less painfull especially for old processors, but it comes with some compatibility issues: CSS3 is not compatible with older browsers, so if you need to support older browsers too, check out [`simpler-sidebar`](https://github.com/ctrlmaniac/sidebar/tree/master/packages/simpler) plugin instead.
